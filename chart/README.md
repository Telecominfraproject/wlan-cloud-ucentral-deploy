# openwifi

This Helm chart helps to deploy OpenWIFI Cloud SDK with all required dependencies to the Kubernetes clusters. The purpose of this chart is to set up the correct connections between other microservices and other dependencies with correct Values and other charts as dependencies in [chart definition](Chart.yaml)

## TL;DR;

[helm-git](https://github.com/aslafy-z/helm-git) is required for remote the installation as it pull charts from other repositories for the deployment, so install it if you don't have it already.

Using that you can deploy Cloud SDK with 2 setups - without TLS certificates for RESTAPI endpoints and with them.

In both cases Websocket endpoint should be exposed through LoadBalancer. In order to get IP address or DNS FQDN of that endpoint you may refer to `kubectl get svc | grep proxy | awk -F ' ' '{print $4}'`. Used port is 15002, but you would need to disable TLS check on AP side since certificate is issued for `*.wlan.local`.

### Deployment with TLS certificates

This deployment method requires usage of [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) (tested minimal Helm chart version is `v1.6.1`) in your Kubernetes installation in order to issue self-signed PKI for internal communication. In this case you will have to trust the self-signed certificates via your browser. Just like in previous method you still need OWGW Websocket TLS certificate, so you can use the same certificates with another values file using these commands:

```bash
$ helm dependency update
$ kubectl create secret generic openwifi-certs --from-file=../docker-compose/certs/
$ helm upgrade --install -f environment-values/values.base.secure.yaml openwifi .
```

In order to access the UI and other RESTAPI endpoints you should run the following commands after the deployment:

```
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/proxy 5912 5913 16001 16002 16003 16004 16005 16006 16009 &
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/owrrm 16789 &
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/owgwui 8080:80 &
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/owprovui 8088:80 &
```

From here Web UI may be accessed using http://localhost:8080 and Provisioning UI may be accessed using http://localhost:8088 .

### Deployment without TLS certificates

**IMPORTANT** Currently this method is not available due to issues in current implementation on microservices side (not being able to use Web UI because of error on Websocket upgrade on OWGW connections), please use TLS method for now.

For this deployment method you will need to disable usage of TLS certificates, yet you will still need a TLS certificate for Websocket endpoint of OWGW. Here are the required steps for the deployment where websocket certificates from [docker-compose certs directory](../docker-compose/certs) and special values file to disable TLS for REST API endpoint will be used:

```bash
$ helm dependency update
$ kubectl create secret generic openwifi-certs --from-file=../docker-compose/certs/
$ helm upgrade --install -f environment-values/values.base.insecure.yaml openwifi .
```

In order to access the UI and other RESTAPI endpoints you should run the following commands after the deployment:

```
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/proxy 5912 5913 16001 16002 16003 16004 16005 16006 16009 &
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/owrrm 16789 &
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/owgwui 8080:80 &
$ kubectl port-forward deployment/owprovui 8088:80 &
```

From here Web UI may be accessed using http://localhost:8080 and Provisioning UI may be accessed using http://localhost:8088 .

During the requests through UI errors may happen - that means that you haven't added certificate exception in browser. In order to that open browser dev tools (F12), open Network tab and see what requests are failing, open them and accept the exceptions.

### Default password change

Then change the default password as described in [owsec docs](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-ucentralsec/tree/main#changing-default-password).

Values files passed in the installation is using default certificates that may be used for initial evaluation (same certificates are used in [docker-compose](../docker-compose/certs) method) using `*.wlan.local` domains. If you want to change those certificates, please set them in Helm values files instead of default certificates (see default values in `values.yaml` file).

If you are using default values without changing [OWSEC config properties](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-ucentralsec/blob/939869948f77575ba0e92c0fb12f2197802ffe71/helm/values.yaml#L212-L213) in your values file, you may access the WebUI using following credentials:

> Username: tip@ucentral.com
> Password: openwifi

## Introduction

This chart bootstraps the OpenWIFI Cloud SDK on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager.

Current dependencies may be found in [chart definition](Chart.yaml) and list will be extended when new services will be introduced.

## Installing the Chart

There are multiple ways to install this chart. Described commands will deploy the OpenWIFI Cloud SDK on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that will be overwritten above default values from dependent charts.

### Installation using local git repo

To install the chart from local git repo with the release name `my-release` you need to first update dependencies as it is required with dependencies deployed by helm-git:

```bash
$ helm dependency update
$ helm install .
```

### Installation using remote chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release` you need to first update dependencies as it is required with dependencies deployed by helm-git:

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release git+https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-ucentral-deploy@chart/openwifi-0.1.0.tgz?ref=main
```

### Installation using external repo

This approach requires adding external helm repo and new versions are build for every [release](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-ucentral-deploy/releases):

```bash
helm repo add tip-wlan https://tip.jfrog.io/artifactory/tip-wlan-cloud-ucentral-helm/
helm install my-release tip-wlan/openwifi
```

## Required password changing on the first startup

One important action that must be done before using the deployment is changing password for the default user in owsec as described in [owsec docs](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-ucentralsec/tree/main#changing-default-password). Please use these docs to find the actions that must be done **after** the deployment in order to start using your deployment.

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```bash
$ helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configuration

If required, further overrides may be passed. They will be merged with default values from this chart and other sub-charts with priority to values you'll pass.

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release \
  --set owgw.replicaCount=1 \
    .
```

The above command sets that only 1 instance of OpenWIFI Gateway to be running

Alternatively, a YAML file that specifies the values for the parameters can be provided while installing the chart. For example,

```bash
$ helm install --name my-release -f values.yaml .
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml) as a base for customization.

## Optional features

Some features of the SDK are not enabled by default, but you may enable them by changing your values file. Below you may find information about supported features and values that may be used as a base to enable these changes. As an example of used values you may check values files in [wlan-testing](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-testing/tree/master/helm/ucentral) repository that are used for different automated testing pipelines.

If you want to enable different features, you may try passing additional values files using `-f` flag during `helm install/upgrade` commands.

### Cluster systeminfo check

By setting `clusterinfo.enabled` to `true` you may enable job on post-install/post-upgrade step that will do the following:

1. Change default security credentials from credentials set in OWSEC configuration file (see 'Required password changing on the first startup' block above)
2. Check if all services started responding correctly after the deployment using systeminfo REST API method

In order to do that, you need to additionally set multiple parameters:

1. clusterinfo.public_env_variables.OWSEC - OWSEC endpoint to use for CLI tools
2. clusterinfo.secret_env_variables.OWSEC_DEFAULT_USERNAME - username used for CLI requests (see OWSEC configuration file for details)
3. clusterinfo.secret_env_variables.OWSEC_DEFAULT_PASSWORD - default password stored in OWSEC configuration that is required for initial password change
4. clusterinfo.secret_env_variables.OWSEC_NEW_PASSWORD - new password that should be set instead of default OWSEC password. It is set only once, then used all the time. Password must comply https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-ucentralsec/#authenticationvalidationexpression

If you are interested in script itself, see [script](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-ucentral-deploy/blob/main/chart/docker/clustersysteminfo).

You may see example values to enable this feature in [values.enable-clustersysteminfo.yaml](./feature-values/values.enable-clustersysteminfo.yaml).

### Load simulation

Chart also allows to install [OWLS](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-owls) and [OWLS-UI](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-owls-ui) alongside your installation if you are interested in load testing your installation. See services repositories for available options and configuration details.

You may see example values to enable this feature in [values.enable-owls.yaml](./feature-values/values.enable-owls.yaml).

### HAproxy

In order to use single point of entry for all services (may be used for one cloud Load Balancer per installation) HAproxy is installed by default with other services. HAproxy is working in TCP proxy mode, so every TLS certificate is managed by services themself, while it is possible to pass requests from cloud load balancer to services using same ports (configuration of cloud load balancer may vary from cloud provider to provider).

By default, this option is enabled, but you may disable it and make per-service LoadBalancer using values in [values.disable-haproxy.yaml](./feature-values/values.disable-haproxy.yaml).

### OWGW unsafe sysctls

By default, Linux is using quite adequate sysctl values for TCP keepalive, but OWGW may keep disconnected APs in stuck state preventing it from connecting back. This may be changed by setting some sysctls to lower values:

- net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl
- net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes - 2
- net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time - 45

However, this change is [not considered safe by Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/sysctl-cluster/#enabling-unsafe-sysctls), and it requires to pass additional argument to your Kubelets services in your Kubernetes cluster:

```
--allowed-unsafe-sysctls net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_intvl,net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_probes,net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time
```

After this change you may pass additional parameters to OWGW helm chart. You may see example values in [values.owgw-unsafe-sysctl.yaml](./feature-values/values.owgw-unsafe-sysctl.yaml)

### Private REST API cert-manager managed certificates

All services have 2 REST API endpoints - private and public one. Private endpoint is used for inter-service communication and should not be exposed to the world, but since it also requires TLS in order to work correctly, additional optional logic was implemented that allows to manage TLS certificates for such endpoints to be managed by [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager). In order to activate this feature following steps are required:

0. Install and configure [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/) in your cluster
1. Enable option by setting `restapiCerts.enabled`
2. If you have a different Kubernetes cluster domain, adapt `restapiCerts.clusterDomain` to your cluster domain
3. Add additional parameters for services in order to mount certificates secrets in pods, use certificates by service and add public environment variable that will add cert-manager managed CA certificate to pod's trusted chain (see [OWGW docker-entrypoint.sh](https://github.com/Telecominfraproject/wlan-cloud-ucentralgw/blob/master/docker-entrypoint.sh) as example of how it is done)

You may see example values to enable this feature in [values.restapi-certmanager-certs.yaml](./feature-values/values.restapi-certmanager-certs.yaml).

### Unsecure REST API endpoints

If you want, you may use configuration property `openwifi.security.restapi.disable=true` in order to disable TLS requirements on REST API endpoints which basically only requires OWGW Websocket TLS certificate in order to deploy the whole environment. If you will pass certificates into the container they will be ignored.

You may see example values to enable this feature in [values.restapi-disable-tls.yaml](./feature-values/values.restapi-disable-tls.yaml).

### PostgreSQL storage option for services

By default, all microservices except RRM service use SQLite as default storage driver, but it is possible to use PostgreSQL for that purpose. Both [cluster-per-microservice](environment-values/values.openwifi-qa.external-db.yaml) and [cluster per installation](environment-values/values.openwifi-qa.single-external-db.yaml) deployments method may be used.

## Environment specific values

This repository contains values files that may be used in the same manner as feature values above to deploy to specific runtime environments (including different cloud deployments).

Some environments are using [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) service to dynamically set DNS records, but you may manage your records manually

### AWS EKS

EKS based installation assumes that you are using [AWS Load Balancer controller](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller) so that all required ALBs and NLBs are created automatically. Also, it is assumed that you have Route53 managed DNS zone, and you've issued wildcard certificate for one of your zones that may be used by Load Balancers.

You may see example values for this environment in [values.aws.yaml](./environment-values/values.aws.yaml).
